# hello-world
My name is John
I am embarking on my second act in life by getting back into coding
I used to be very text savvy growing up but due to a serious neurological condition that became full blown at 21 in 2000 after recovering some function in about 2003 I have been in recovery with the odd set back just under 21 years and in the last year I have been learning Mandarin and finding it fairly easy to memorize and assembly sentences on Duolingo.
This lead me to hope that I still could get up to speed with coding after a near 25 absence so I downloaded the app Programming Hub and managed to complete a few courses which has shown that hope was real founded.
so for most of this last year I have been reading up on and coding in python now I feel I can move onto the area of computing science that has held my interest since before I can remember and that is AI,so I have brought a bunch of kindle books on at first the basics of python to get me used to the language and then in the last few months I have been buying Machine Learning books, one genetic algorithmn book and one book called clean code in python.
should say in the mid 90s I did a term at my local FE/community college studying computing in general along with learning pascal so when I first getting my head around python I was like this way easier to follow than pascal
I am from and live in Northern Scotland
